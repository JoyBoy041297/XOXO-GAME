XOXO Game
Welcome to the XOXO Game! This is a simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns to mark 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

The game board consists of a 3x3 grid of clickable boxes.
Players take turns clicking on an empty box to make their move.
The game alternates between 'X' and 'O' for each player.
The game ends when one player has three marks in a row or when all boxes are filled (resulting in a tie).
